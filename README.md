# Catch of the Day

This is my first React project that I did as part of the [React For Beginners by Wes Bos](https://reactforbeginners.com).  The purpose of this project was to create an
online fish market where all the features were created using React components.

## Getting Started

## Software requirements

- React 15.0.0

- Firebase 2.3.1

- LocalStorage

```
Note:  Please see package.json for additional details regarding dependencies.
```

## Create Firebase Account

 ```
 https://firebase.google.com
 ```

## Create Firebase Project

1.  `Click to console` in the upper hand of the web page.

2.  Click `Create New Project`

3.  Set `Project name` to `catch of the day`

4.  Click `Create Project`

## Update the Firebase Project path to your project

1. Replace `YOUR-FIREBASE-PROJECT-URL` with the URL that appears in the
   `Database` section within the Firebase console.  Thus, you'll need to
   update the following files:

   ```
   /path/to/project/scripts/components/App.js
   /path/to/project/scripts/components/Inventory.js
   ```

## Starting the local server

```
$ gulp
```

Note:  This will allow you to make changes to the running application without
       having to restart the server.

## Configuring Authentication

  ```
  TBD
  ```

## Production Deployment

  ```
  TBD
  ```
